## Using K-means Analysis to Classify Synthetic Spectral Profiles from Numerical Simulations of the Solar Atmosphere

## Introduction
We classify the synthetic profiles of MG II k & h in our dataset (544005 profiles) using k-means analysis. We show the locations of the k-means for certain cluster numbers as well as the spectral profile for k-mean label corresponding to those location.This code allows to read RH (in netCDF format) profiles. It allows to selects specific lines, interpolate in an uniform spectra and perform k-mean analysis. 

## Installation
Works on MacOS, Linux, and Windows.
