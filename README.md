## K-Means-IRIS

## Introduction
The solar atmosphere is very corrugate with various features and processes, such as spicules, jets, and ejections. Simulations of the solar atmosphere are necessary to interpret the observations. The results uses the state-of the-art models of the solar atmosphere, which are unique in the sense that they are able to, among other processes, produce self-consistently type II spicules, which which may play a role in heating the coronal loops associated with the spicules and generating Alfv√©nic waves. We classify the synthetic profiles of MG II k & h in our dataset (544005 profiles) using k-means analysis. We show the locations of the k-means for certain cluster numbers as well as the spectral profile for k-mean label corresponding to those location.
