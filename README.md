## Using K-means Analysis to Classify Synthetic Spectral Profiles from Numerical Simulations of the Solar Atmosphere

## Introduction
We classify the synthetic profiles of MG II k & h in our dataset (544005 profiles) using k-means analysis. We show the locations of the k-means for certain cluster numbers as well as the spectral profile for k-mean label corresponding to those location.This code allows to read RH (in netCDF format) profiles. It allows to selects specific lines, interpolate in an uniform spectra and perform k-mean analysis. 

## Installation
Works on MacOS, Linux, and Windows.

1) Download the Python 3.6 version (can also download 2.7 version if necessary) 

2) Clone the latest version of helita from Github: git clone https://github.com/jamiehuang00/K-Means-IRIS and download to desktop

3) Use Terminal to compile and run the code

Requires Python 3.0 or higher.

## Usage
In order to run the code, enter this on terminal or Jupyter Notebook: 

python
***

ipython

>>> import numpy as np

>>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

>>> from sklearn.cluster import KMeans

>>> from sklearn.cluster import MiniBatchKMeans

>>> import pickle

>>> import imp

>>> import helita

>>> cd ~/helita/helita/sim

>>> from helita import kmeans as km

>>> __init__

>>> interp()

>>> time_import(tm, inertia, t0)

>>> fit(t0)

>>> create_km_map()

>>> create_k_means_maps(self, wvl)

>>> create_spectral_map(self, i3, wvl, ax)
